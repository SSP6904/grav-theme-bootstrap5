## Intro
This theme features the Bootstrap 5 CSS libary that is intergrated with GravCMS. It features a form theme, custom navbars, logo placements, and more! This is entirely based off the Bootstrapper plugin, along with the offical theme from the Grav devoplers. You also get a auto dark mode feature (requires javascript) as a addional bonus! In fact, it works just like any other script you can find!

## Installing
There is 2 versions of this theme. The first one includes a offcanvas navbar, while the other one just has the normal navbar. You can choose whatever suits you. Go to the releases page, click the latest release, and download one of the versions. Both are in a ZIP format.

Unzip the archive to your themes directory. The directory is located in the "users" folder withen your GravCMS install folder. After that, you can either use the Admin portal to enable the theme, or use the config.yaml file to enable the theme. ðŸ˜‰
